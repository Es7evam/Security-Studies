# Security Studies

This is the repository where I'll try to keep some of my InfoSec study material. They'll be separated in folders, each one representing some category and, inside that, several [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files where the notes will be kept, together with a README.md file, indicating the order I recommend you to read it.

* This is not the final version and will keep on updating. Feel free to contribute.
* This can be read as a [Gitbook](https://es7evam.gitbook.io/security-studies/).
* The source can be found on [Github](https://github.com/Es7evam/Security-Studies/).
