# Security-Studies

This is the repository where I'll try to keep some of my InfoSec study material.
They'll be separated in folders, each one representing some category and, inside that, several [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files where the notes will be kept, together with a README.md file, indicating the order I recommend you to read it.
