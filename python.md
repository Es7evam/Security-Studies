# Python Codes

Here I'll post some of my codes referent to python studies. The codes will be mainly using python 2.7. That is always indicated at the top of each one. Some of them are at the book [Black Hat Python](https://books.google.com.br/books/about/Black_Hat_Python.html?id=Jb7VBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false). Most of them not 100% equal to it. Most of the files will have comments trying to explain in a few words what the new commands do.

## Networking
