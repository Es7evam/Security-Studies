# Reverse Engineering
Here I'll be studying and taking notes on reverse engineering in general. <br>
Later on I plan to organize this in a way that has a planned sequence and flow, but for now I recommend you to go on this order:
- [Registers and Data Types](RegistersAndDataTypes.md)

- [gdb](GDB.md) - Gnu Project Debugger

- [Radare2](Radare2.md) - Forensics tool, a scriptable commandline hexadecimal editor able to open disk files, binary analyzer, disassembler, debugger, attaching to remote gdb servers
